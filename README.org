** Installation
These steps assume a fresh installation of EndeavourOS with Gnome installed.

#+BEGIN_SRC
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/shiva-tk/dots.git

# Move into your home directory
mv dots ~/
cd ~/dots

# Run install.sh
./install.sh
#+END_SRC

This install script isn't particularly stable, and may require some tinkering.

The script:
1. Installs dependencies via AUR / pacman.
2. Uses GNU stow to place all configuration files in the correct directories.
3. Installs ghc / stack via ghcup, and then installs xmonad via stack.
   For managing haskell libraries, ghcup is more dependable than pacman, so i prefer this method.
4. Sets up ly as a desktop manager - this step assumes gdm is currently set as the desktop manager.
5. Installs a picom fork from github, for animations / nice rounded borders.
   This fork also supports blurring, if you like.
6. Changes the shell to zsh.
7. Installs doom emacs from github.
