# My Dotfiles

A minimal set up, with a focus on functionality, aesthetics and ergonomics.

## Installation

These steps assume a fresh installation of EndeavourOS with Gnome installed.

1. Install the necessary packages:
```
yay -S --needed < packages.txt
```
2. Use GNU Stow to set up dotfiles:
```
stow *
```
